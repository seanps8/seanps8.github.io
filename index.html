            Hello, my name is Sean Stubbs. I was born and raised in Sterling, VA. 
            I grew up with 3 brothers and sisters there, along with some pets as well. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            I love playing baseball, ping pong and doing anything outdoors. I love to 
            travel to different places, whether it be for sight-seeing or snowboarding 
            in the winter. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a recent graduate from Virginia Tech (Go Hokies), and love to return during 
            football seasons and the summer time. 
        </p>
        <p class="abc">
            A TV show I am currently watching is 'Better Call Saul', which is a prequel to the 
            AMC series 'Breaking Bad'. The show covers the beginning stages of Saul Goodman's 
            lawyering career, and also touches on other characters from the show. 
        </p>
        <p class="abc">
            My dream job is to work for an MLB team in a technical role, since I can't really
            work for an MLB team as a player. 
        </p>
